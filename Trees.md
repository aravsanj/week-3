**Let's understand some key points of the Tree data structure.**

- A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy.
  
- A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.

- In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so the type of data would be a string.

- Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes that can be called children.

Root: The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent.

Child node: If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is known as a child node.

Parent: If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to be the parent of that sub-node.

Sibling: The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.

Leaf Node:- The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node, is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes.

Internal nodes: A node has at least one child node known as an internal node.

Ancestor node:- An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are the ancestors of node 10.

Descendant: The immediate successor of the given node is known as a descendant of a node. In the above figure, 10 is the descendant of node 5
